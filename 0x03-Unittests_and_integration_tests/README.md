# ðŸ§®Unit and Integration Testing in Python
This project demonstrates how to write unit and integration tests using the Python's built-in unittest framework and the mock object library. The goal is to showcase effective techniques for testing different components of a Python application.

# ðŸ§®The key objectives of this project are:

1. **Unit Testing**: Develop comprehensive unit tests to verify the correctness of individual components or modules in isolation.
2. **Integration Testing**: Create integration tests to ensure the correct interaction and communication between various modules or subsystems.
3. **Mocking**: Utilize the mock object library to simulate dependencies and external resources, allowing for more controlled and isolated testing.
4. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Explore the TDD approach, where tests are written before the actual implementation, to drive the design and development of the application.

By completing this project, you will gain practical experience in implementing a robust testing strategy for your Python applications, improving code quality, maintainability, and reliability.
